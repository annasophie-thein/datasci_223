# DATASCI 223 README.md

## Introduction
Hi! I'm Anna-Sophie. I'm a final year medical student from the University of Copenhagen and first year M.A.S. student at UCSF. I'm doing clinical- and epidemiological studies and my research mainly focuses on glaucoma.

## Instruction
My solutions to exercise 1 (Making the Grade) can be found here: [https://github.com/annasophie-thein/datasci_223/tree/main/exercises/1-foundations)]. The file is named "exercise.py".

## Comments about the course
I hope to get familiar with how to use Python and learn more about the programming in general. Python, GitHub, IDEs, etc. were all new to me so there were many challenges for this first exercised - but I've already learned many new things as well.
