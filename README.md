# DATASCI 223 README.md

## Introduction
Hi! I'm Anna-Sophie. I'm a final year medical student from the University of Copenhagen and first year M.A.S. student at UCSF. I'm doing clinical- and epidemiological studies and my research mainly focuses on glaucoma.

## Instruction for exercise 1 
My solutions to exercise 1 (Making the Grade) can be found here: https://github.com/annasophie-thein/datasci_223/tree/main/exercises/1-foundations. The file is named "exercise1.py".

## Instruction for exercise 2
My solutions to exercise 2 (Dirty Emnist) can be found here: https://github.com/annasophie-thein/datasci_223/blob/main/exercises/2-data-munging/exercise2.py. The file is named "exercise2.py". I could not figure out how to find and deal with the messed up data with a normal distribution centered on 0.25. 

## Instruction for exercise 3
My solutions to exercise 3 (Analyzing Chinook Database) can be found here: https://github.com/annasophie-thein/datasci_223/blob/main/exercises/3-sql-queries/exercise3.ipynb). The file is named "exercise3.py". 

## Instruction for exercise 4
I did not manage to complete the assignment so this is as far as I got. I generally had trouble running the code in order to trouble shoot as Google Collab crashed continually. My solutions to exercise 4 (Classification on emnist) can be found here: https://github.com/annasophie-thein/datasci_223/blob/main/exercises/4-classification/exercise4.ipynb.
